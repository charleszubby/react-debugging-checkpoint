**Debugging Process**: Step-by-step guide on how to set up the app, identify issues, and use React Developer Tools.

### Step 1: Set Up the Application

Install React Development Tool in browser extension.
Ensure that the application runs in your local development environment at any PORT.

### Step 2: Open React Developer Tools

Open your browser's DevTools (usually via F12 or right-click and select "Inspect").
Switch to the "React" tab to inspect the components of your application.
This tool provides a tree view of all the components in the app, including their props and state.

### Step 3: Inspect Component Tree

Inspect the component tree to get an overview of how your components are structured. Click on a component to check its state, props, and lifecycle hooks. Use the following features for detailed inspection:

Props: Ensure that each component receives the correct props.
State: Verify that the state reflects the correct values as you interact with the application.
Hooks: If the component uses hooks, check if they are working as expected (e.g., useState, useEffect).

### Step 4: Identify Common Issues

Incorrect State Values;
Missing or Incorrect props;
Unexpected Re-render;

### Step 5: Performance Optimization

Check Component Re-renders;
Optimization Techniques;

### Step 7: Verify Application Functionality

Ensure State and Props: Check that all components receive the correct state and props.
Check Component Behavior: Ensure that all components render and function as expected.
Recheck Performance: Ensure that performance optimizations are in place, and no unnecessary re-renders occur.
